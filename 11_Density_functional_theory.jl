In the final lectures we will consider the quantum-chemical modelling of materials using Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT) as one example. This model is used on a regular basis (think thousands of times per day on standard supercomputers) to simulate the properties of materials from first princples. That is just from the atomic structure of a material, this approach is able to make predictions about the physical and chemical properties. For designing new catalysts, batteries, solar cells, quantum computing devices, ... this is an invaluable asset.

As we will see in the onset DFT turns out to be a slight generalisation of what we discussed so far, namely a non-linear eigenvalue problem. In this notebook we present the overall mathematical framework of the problem and how it is solved numerically. In the next notebooks we present some strategies for modelling and estimating numerical and model error in the context of DFT simulations by refining and applying some of the ideas of this course.

## DFT: A non-linear eigenvalue problem

Consider a Schrödinger Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H} = - \frac12 \Delta + V$ on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^{3N})$. As discussed before, if $V$ is sufficiently nice this operator is self-adjoint with $Q(\mathcal{H}) = H^1(\mathbb{R}^{3N})$ and to get the ground state (first eigenvalue) we would seek to solve the problem
```math
\tag{1}
\min_{\Psi \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^\textcolor{red}{3N})} \frac{\langle \Psi, \mathcal{H} \Psi\rangle_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^\textcolor{red}{3N})}
}{\langle \Psi, \Psi\rangle_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^\textcolor{red}{3N})}}
```
which notably involves two integrals over the entire space $\mathbb{R}^{3N}$ as part of the inner products.

The dimension $3N$ of this problem is determined by the number $N$ of the considered particles. For materials science and chemistry one important setting is where one aims to model the **electrons in a material** or **chemical system**. In that case $N$ is equal to the number of electrons. Even for moderate systems, such as a silicon crystal, we have $N = 28$ and $3N = 84$. Therefore the integrals to be evaluated as part of (1) get very quickly very challenging.

To illustrate this point further. If we want the inner product $\langle \Psi, \Psi\rangle_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^\textcolor{red}{3N})}$ to be computed in **1 year** using a trapezoidal rule with two sampling points along every dimension, then **evaluating one sample may take at most**

which is **impossible due to physical constraints in modern computer hardware**.

The way out to break this curse of dimensionality are **mean-field methods**. One such approach is density-functional theory (DFT). Without going into details the idea is to approximate the states $\Psi$ by antisymmetric tensor products
```math
\widetilde{\Psi}(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_N) = \frac{1}{N!} \det \begin{pmatrix}
\psi_1(r_1) & \psi_1(r_2) & \cdots & \psi_1(r_N) \\
\psi_2(r_1) & \psi_2(r_2) & \cdots & \psi_2(r_N) \\
\vdots &  & \ddots & \vdots \\
\psi_N(r_1) & \psi_N(r_2) & \cdots & \psi_N(r_N)
\end{pmatrix}
```
where
```math
\begin{aligned}
\forall i, j: \quad r_i \in \mathbb{R}^3, \psi_i \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^{\textcolor{red}{3}}), \langle \psi_i, \psi_j \rangle_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^{\textcolor{red}{3}})} = \delta_{ij}.
\end{aligned}
```
In this field such a $\widetilde{\Psi}$ is usually called a **Slater determinant**. We additionally collect the degrees of freedom of $\widetilde{\Psi}$ in a tuple
$\Phi = (\psi_1, \psi_2, \ldots, \psi_N) \in \left(H^1(\mathbb{R}^3)\right)^N$.
"""

# ╔═╡ 9b2bc5db-716b-4e07-a931-c7a4212be13f

One natural idea would be now to insert $\widetilde{\Psi}$ into (1), i.e. minimising $\langle \widetilde{\Psi}, \mathcal{H} \widetilde{\Psi}\rangle_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^\textcolor{red}{3N})}$ wrt. the unknows $\Phi$. This is called **Hartree-Fock** and indeed sometimes considered. However, for many applications a more accurate description is the related **Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT)**, where one additionally modifies the energy expression and considers a minimisation problem
```math
\tag{2}
\Phi_\ast = \mathop{\text{argmin}}_{\substack{\psi_i \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^3) \\ \langle\psi_i, \psi_j\rangle=\delta_{ij} }} \, E_\text{KS}(\Phi)
```
Without going into too many details $E_\text{KS}(\Phi)$ is similar to $\langle \widetilde{\Psi}, \mathcal{H} \widetilde{\Psi}\rangle_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^\textcolor{red}{3N})}$, but not identical. Precisely the **energy functional** $E_\text{KS}(\Phi)$ has the terms
```math
\tag{3}
\begin{aligned}
E_\text{KS}(\Phi) &= \frac12 \sum_{n=1}^N \langle\nabla \psi_n, \nabla \psi_n\rangle
&& \text{\textit{Kinetic energy}} \\
	&+ \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \frac{\rho_\Phi(r) \rho_\Phi(r')}{|r-r'|} dr dr'
&& \text{\textit{Classical electron-electron repulsion}} \\
	&+ E_\text{xc}(\rho_\Phi) && \text{\textbf{QM: exchange-correlation functional}} \\
	&+ \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \rho_\Phi(r) V_\text{ext}(r) d r
&& \text{\textit{electron-nuclear attraction}}
\end{aligned}
```
where the external potential describes the Coulombic attraction of electrons
with the nuclei
and the **electron density** is
```math
\rho_\Phi(r) = \sum_{n=1}^N |\psi_n(r)|^2,
```
which is a function $\mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}$ and describes the density of electronic charge at every point in space.

To see the connection to the usual eigenvalue problems we considered, consider the case $N=1$. For a subclass of models (called self-interaction-free DFT) equation (3) then reduces to the first and the last term, i.e.
```math
E_\text{KS}(\psi_1) = \frac12 \langle\nabla \psi_1, \nabla \psi_1\rangle + \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |\psi_i(r)|^2  V_\text{ext}(r)\, \text{d} r
```
where $ρ_\Phi(r) = |\psi_1(r)|^2$ has been inserted. Using partial integration
on the first term this can be rewritten as
```math
E_\text{KS}(\psi_1) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \psi_i^\ast, \left(-\frac12 \Delta + V_\text{ext} \right) \psi_i,
```
which is the Rayleigh quotient of the Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H} = -\frac12 \Delta + V_\text{ext}$ under the condition $\| \psi_1 \| = 1$. For this setting the minimisation problem (2) is thus nothing else than seeking the lowest-energy state (ground state) of $\mathcal{H}$, i.e. finding the smallest eigenvector $\psi_1$.

In other words problem (2) is a standard eigenvalue problem.

# ╔═╡ 0e1cc724-329e-4487-ac16-57a85ca84502
md"""
For more particles $N > 1$ and general models the situation is more involved and a fully rigorous treatment leads to the result that the stationarity conditions of (2) have the form of a **non-linear eigenvalue problem**
```math
\tag{4}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&\left( -\frac12 \Delta + V\left(\rho_\Phi\right) \right) \psi_i = \varepsilon_i \psi_i, \quad \text{for} \ 1 \leq i \leq N \\
V(\rho) = &\, V_\text{ext} + V_H(\rho) + V_\text{xc}(\rho), \\
\rho_\Phi = &\sum_{i=1}^N |\psi_i|^2, \\
\end{aligned}
\right.
```
where the **Hartree potential** $V_H$ and **exchange-correlation potential** $V_\text{xc}$ are
```math
\begin{aligned}
V_H(\rho) &= \nabla_\rho E_H(\rho) & V_\text{xc}(\rho) &= \nabla_\rho E_\text{xc}(\rho) \\
E_H(\rho) &= \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \frac{\rho(r) \rho(r')}{|r-r'|} dr dr'
\end{aligned}
```
and one often summarises $E_\text{Hxc}(\rho) = E_H(\rho) + E_\text{xc}(\rho)$
and $V_\text{Hxc}(\rho) = V_H(\rho) + V_\text{xc}(\rho)$.

## Self-consistent field algorithm
Introducing the **potential-to-density map**
```math
\tag{5}
D(V) = \sum_{i=1}^N |\psi_i|^2
```
where $\psi_i$ are the $N$ lowest-energy eigenfunctions of$\left(-\frac12 \Delta + V\right) \psi_i = \varepsilon_i \psi_i$
allows to write the DFT problem in the short-hand form
```math
\tag{6}
\boxed{\rho = D(V(\rho)),}
```
which is a fixed-point problem in $\rho$, also known as the 
**self-consistent field problem** (SCF problem).
Notice that computing $D(V)$ requires the diagonalisation of the operator
$-\frac12 \Delta + V$, which is usually the most
expensive step when solving the SCF problem.

One usually follows an iterative procedure
to solve the above SCF problem $\rho = D(V(\rho))$.
That is to say that starting from an initial guess $\rho_0$ one then
computes $D(V(\rho_n))$ for a sequence of iterates $\rho_n$
until input and output are close enough.
That is until the residual
```math
\tag{7}
R(\rho_n) = D(V(\rho_n)) - \rho_n
```
is small. More details below, see [Convergence and preconditioning techniques](#Convergence-and-preconditioning-techniques).

Related to this section is also
the discussion in DFTK documentation in the chapter [Introduction to density-functional theory](https://docs.dftk.org/stable/guide/density_functional_theory/).

### Perodic problems and plane-wave discretisations

It turns out that if $V_\text{ext}$
is a $\mathbb{L}$-periodic potential for a lattice $\mathbb{L}$ and unit cell $\Omega$,
then also $\rho$ and as a result the total potential $V$ are $\mathbb{L}$-periodic enabling a Bloch decomposition for the **Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian** $-\frac12 \Delta + V\left(\rho_\Phi\right)$ from (4).
Following similar arguments to the setting of linear eigenvalue problems discussed in [Periodic problems](https://teaching.matmat.org/error-control/10_Periodic_problems.html) than leads to very similar expressions in (3), (4) and (5) with mainly additional integrals over $k$-points appearing.

For example the potential-to-density map becomes
```math
D(V) = \frac{1}{|\Omega^\ast|} \int_{k\in \overline{\Omega}^\ast} \sum_{n=1}^N
|\psi_{nk}|^2
```
where the $\psi_{nk}$ are for each $k$ the $N$ lowest-energy eigenfunctions of
the Bloch fiber
```math
\tag{8}
\Big(\tfrac12 (-i \nabla + k)^2 + V\Big) \psi_{nk} = ε_{nk} \psi_{nk}.
```
A final modification is that for metallic systems it is often useful to introduce a **smearing temperature** $T$. This changes the minimised energy functional (2) by adding an entropy term and furthermore introduces another modification of the potential-to-density map to give
```math
D(V) = \frac{1}{|\Omega^\ast|} \int_{k\in \overline{\Omega}^\ast} \sum_{n=1}^{\mathcal{N}}
f(\tfrac{ε_{nk} - ε_F}{T}) \ |\psi_{nk}|^2
```
where the **smearing function** is for example the Fermi-Dirac function
$f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^x}$
and the number of computed orbitals
$\mathcal{N} \gg N$[^1] and $ε_F$ is chosen to give the correct number of electrons, i.e. to ensure that
```math
\int_{\Omega} D(V) = \int_{\Omega} \frac{1}{|\Omega^\ast|} \int_{k\in \overline{\Omega}^\ast}  f(\tfrac{ε_{nk} - ε_F}{T})\ |\psi_{nk}|^2 = N.
```

To **discretise the problem** we now choose a finite number of ``k``-points, $\mathbb K \subset \overline{\Omega^*}$ as well as at each $k$-point employ a $k$-adapted plane-wave basis set
```math
  \mathbb B^{E_\text{cut}}_{k} = \left  \{ e_G \middle \vert G \in \mathbb L^* , \tfrac1{2} |G+k|^2 \leq E_\text{cut} \right \}
```
to solve (8) as discussed in [Periodic problems](https://teaching.matmat.org/error-control/10_Periodic_problems.html).
Notably after discretisation the density-potential map takes the form
```math
\tag{9}
\boxed{
D(V) = \sum_{n=1}^{\mathcal{N}} \sum_{k \in \mathbb{K}}
f(\tfrac{ε_{nk} - ε_F}{T}) \ |\psi_{nk}|^2
}
```
which is usually employed in practice.

[^1]: In theory even $\mathcal{N} = \infty$, but this is impossible in practice and therefore a modelling choice.

### Example: A first DFT calculation of a silicon crystal

In the section on [periodic problems](https://teaching.matmat.org/error-control/10_Periodic_problems.html#Adding-potentials) we considered the computation of the band structure of $-\frac12 \Delta + V$ for a *linear* Hamiltonian (not dependent on $\rho$) and one 1D.

We now extend this to 3D and the DFT computation on a silicon crystal, which is a problem of practical relevance.
